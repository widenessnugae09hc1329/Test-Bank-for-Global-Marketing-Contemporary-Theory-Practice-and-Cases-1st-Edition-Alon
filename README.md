  * Hailing from America, Europe and the Middle East, the authors of Global Marketing provide a truly international and comparative perspective to the study of marketing. Examples are provided from across the continents encompassing small and medium enterprises (SMEs). In addition, well-researched multinational companies are explored and give justice to the breadth and depth of this field. Cases on well-known companies, such as Disney, Starbucks, Wal-Mart, Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), and Corona are supplemented by cases on lesser-known and smaller companies from emerging markets, such as Proton Car from Malaysia and San Lu from China. In addition to short, end of chapter cases that can be used in classroom discussion, the book also boasts longer, end of book cases which require integration of multiple chapters and synthesis of knowledge to identify and solve international marketing problems.
